      <h1>What is a food swamp and what does this mean for the Bronx?</h1>
      <p>
        The Bronx is described as a “food swamp,” as it has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in the country. But exactly does that term mean and what are some of the effects on the borough?

      <div class="text">Food swamps are areas where residents have restricted access to affordable, healthy food options due geographic distance from a grocery store. While urban areas like the Bronx have public transportation, due to economic factors such as high rent prices many grocery stores have closed in NYC in recent years making the commute to a grocery store difficult. </div>


      <div class="icon">
        <img src="soda-icon.png" alt="Soda" class="center"></div>
      <div class="text">You may have heard of the term “food desert” but “food swamp” refers to areas with a high-density of fast food chains and limited access to nutritional food sources. More than one in three South Bronx residents consumes one or more sugary drinks each day, higher than New York City as a whole (24%).</div>

      <div class="text">Limited access to nutritional and healthy food options can lead to increased health risks such as obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. According to the NYC food policy center’s report, one in five residents in the South Bronx has been diagnosed with diabetes (vs. 12% in NYC). Factors such as drinking a soda once a day can increase an individual’s risk of developing diabetes by 18%.

      <div class="text">Some solutions are community gardens and bodegas providing more nutritious food options. The city launched the “Healthy Bodega” initiative to work with bodegas to provide more healthy food options in areas like the South Bronx.
